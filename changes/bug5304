  o Minor features (pluggable transports):
    - Added option OutboundBindAddressPT to torrc. This option allows users to
      specify which IPv4 and IPv6 address they want pluggable transports to use
      for outgoing IP packets. Tor does not have a way to enforce that the pluggable
      transport honors this option so each pluggable transport will have to
      implement support for this feature. Closes ticket 5304.
